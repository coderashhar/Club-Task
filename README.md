# Mozilla Firefox Club : Upcoming Events

Homepage for the exciting upcoming events hosted by the Mozilla Firefox Club. It includes a dynamic timeline of upcoming events, highlights from past events, a sponsor section to recognize the amazing companies that support the community, and an interactive hero section with a unique mouse cursor animation.

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Hero Section with Cursor Animation**
The hero section features an engaging and interactive cursor animation. As the user moves the mouse across the page, small balls (resembling planets) follow the cursor's movement. These balls move dynamically in response to the cursor's position, creating an engaging and visually stimulating experience for users. This interactive animation enhances the user experience and adds a fun, playful element to the website.

### 2. **Timeline of Upcoming Events**
The website features a visually engaging timeline that highlights upcoming events. The timeline is structured to show events from left to right, with each event represented by a card containing key details, such as the event name, date, and description. Users can easily follow the progression of events over time.

### 3. **Previous Event Highlights**
For those interested in past events, the website includes a section that highlights key moments from previous Mozilla Firefox Club events. This section aims to provide an overview of the impactful activities and experiences that have shaped the community.

### 4. **Sponsor Section**
The sponsor section recognizes the generous companies that support the Mozilla Firefox Club. This section displays the logos of our sponsors, acknowledging their contribution to making the events possible. The logos are displayed in a responsive grid layout, ensuring they are visible and accessible on all screen sizes.
